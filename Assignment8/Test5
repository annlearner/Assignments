oh
well you can say what you want
but you can't say it around here
cause they'll catch you and give you a whipping
well i believe i was right
when i said you were wrong
you didn't like the sound of that
now did you
slow down you're gonna crash
baby you were screaming
it's a blast blast blast
well look out you've got your blinders on
everybody's looking for a way
to get real gone
well here i come and i'm so not scared
got my pedal to the metal
got my hands in the air
well look out you take your blinders off
everybody's looking for a way
to get real gone
real gone
real gone
oh
real gone
real gone
