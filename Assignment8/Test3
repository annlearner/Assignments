OH
Well you can say what you want
But you can't say it around here
Cause they'll catch you and give you a whipping
Well I believe I was right
When I said you were wrong
You didn't like the sound of that
Now did you
Slow down you're gonna crash
Baby you were screaming
It's a blast blast blast
Well look out you've got your blinders on
Everybody's looking for a way
To get real gone
Well here I come And I'm so not scared
Got my pedal to the metal
Got my hands in the air
Well look out you take your blinders off
Everybody's looking for a way
To get real gone
Real Gone
Real Gone
OH
Real Gone
Real Gone
